## Resourcing

The resoures used in this assignment is many websites to get ideas for the project and for the technologies used also 

- w3school.com
- github.com 
- Wimma lab:  project I was working with in WiMMA LAB called conduit I used some function to use java script in the project .
- zara.fi : To have an idea of the front-end should be like even the website 'Zanobia' ended totally differenet 

### use of time to the project was about 80-100h 
 - The time consumed quite alote beacuse I worked with two different websites and I wasn't sure about the best idea to go with but I choice the online store 

## Technology choices with reasoning behind them
- HTML : For front-end development of the website to create a content and add pictures to the page.
-  advanced CSS3 : Responsive design is the term commonly used for describing that approach.For Web developers, it is now fairly common to be called upon to create a Web site or app that changes its user interface depending on the browser or device accessing the site to provide an optimized experience. One approach to this is to create different versions of your site/app for different platforms or browsers and serve them appropriately after detecting which browser or platform is looking at your site. But this is increasingly inefficient: browser sniffing is inherently error prone, and maintaining multiple copies of your code can turn out to be a nightmare.
- Advanced JavaScript : used some js to wotrk with some function so the customer can use the online store to buy items and add item to the cart.
